</header>

<main>
	<p>
		Mauve Software Inc is a consultancy that specializes in cutting edge technology.
		We strive to take science fiction ideas and turn them into reality.
	</p>
	<p>
		We take a holistic approach to decentralization by applying it to every level of the stack.
		Unlike many blockchain solutions, we take a no-nonsense approach to
		decentralized software with a focus on empowering users with
		local-first software that works offline and keeps data in the hands of users.
	</p>
	<p>
		We can take you from initial ideation, to MVPs, and to fully deployed products,
		and help explain how the technology works along the way.
	</p>

		<summary>Decentralized and Distributed Systems</summary>
		We believe in robust systems which don't rely on single points of failure.
		This leads to systems that work in dynamic network environements and scale
		with the network as more data is entered into the system. This is acheived
		using data structures like
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_log">Append-Only Logs</a>
		and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRDT">Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types</a>.
	</details>

		<summary>Peer to Peer Software</summary>
		The status quo for most applications are cloud solutions which centralize
		users' data and act as gatekeepers to their interaction. This has negative
		side effects in the form of censorship, lack of availability in spotty
		internet locations, and lack of user autonomy as their networks are held
		for ransom.
		<br/>
		Peer to Peer software, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer">P2P</a>,
		is an alternate architecture where users store their data on their own devices
		and connect directly to each other to share it. We specialize in leveraging
		protocols such as <a href="https://dat.foundation/">Dat</a>,
		<a href="https://ipfs.com/">IPFS</a>,
		<a href="https://scuttlebutt.nz/">Secure Scuttlebutt</a>,
		<a href="https://github.com/redecentralize/alternative-internet">and many more</a> to
		build robust, <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html">Local-First</a>
		software which improves user experience, privacy, and avoids costly cloud bills.

		<summary>Mesh Networks</summary>
		Not every place in the world has a stable connection to the internet.
		Rural and remote communities, festivals, and developing nations are often
		unable to use traditional internet based applications. Mesh networks enable
		novel information technologies to thrive in these areas through the use of
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_ad_hoc_network">Wireless
		ad hoc Networks</a>. These pair well with P2P software to enable fully local
		applications. If two people are within wireless range of each other,
		they should have the same UX as though they were connected over the internet.

		<summary>Vitual and Augmented Reality</summary>
		In the spirit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk">Cyberpunk</a>
		dreams of the past, we enjoy exploring what's possible with augmeting reality
		with technology. Our focus is on productivity software deployed using
		<a href="https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/">WebXR</a>. This gives us
		flexability in deploying to different headsets without being locked down
		to a sinle game engine or proprietary API. We are also strong believers in
		open source headsets like the <a href="http://leap27.com/">Leap27</a> and
		<a href="https://developer.leapmotion.com/northstar">Project Northstar</a>.
		Our goal is to combine all our areas of expertise into a robust
		<a href="https://github.com/RangerMauve/local-first-cyberspace#local-first-cyberspace">
		local-first cyberpsace</a> that works across mesh networks and automatically
		distributes spatialized content across devices.

		<summary>Web App Development</summary>
		We are experts in the web platform and have been developing applications using full
		stack web technologies for almost a decade with <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>,
		<a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, and have a deep level of knowledge of
		<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML>HTML</a>,
		<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP">HTTP</a>,
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSockets</a>,
		<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a>,
		and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript">JavaScript</a>.
		In addition to front end web development, we have experience orchastrating back end
		infrastrucutre and databases with <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and
		have extensive knowledge of Linux based systems and cloud deployments.

		<summary>Mobile App Development</summary>
		We have been developing cross-platform mobile applications using web technologies
		such as <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Apache Cordova</a> and
		<a href="https://reactnative.dev/">React-Native</a> on both Android and iOS for almost
		a decade, and are comfortalble setting up the full process from initial implementation
		and publishing on the respective app stores.

		<summary>Desktop App Development</summary>
		Although most applications can be most easily deployed through the web, we have extensive
		knowledge in using <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> to deploy desktop
		applications on Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
	</details>
	<details open>
		<summary>Open Source Community Organizing</summary>
		We are strong believers in
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software">Open Source Software</a>
		and have been engaging with and helping to organize open source communities for the
		betterment of the commons.
